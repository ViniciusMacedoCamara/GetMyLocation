# GetMyLocation

A fully native Java Android app to get users current location and open Google Maps with it. Or if the user want, it can be typed latitude and longitude only and search it on Google Maps.

# Label notes
Warning to anyone reading this. The latest versions of Google Maps (^ 10.11.x) are not showing a label
It was tested with the latest version and I was able to verify that the error actually occurs, however, I did a rollback Google Maps to version 9.76.1 where it was possible to show and change the label
There are official forums -> https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/129726279
Please take this into account if you are running any version of Google Maps that has this feature disabled / removed.
