# GetMyLocation

A fully native Java Android app to get users current location and open Google Maps with it. Or if the user want, it can be typed latitude and longitude only and search it on Google Maps.

# Label notes
Warning to anyone reading this. The latest versions of Google Maps (^ 10.11.x) are not showing a label

It was tested with the latest version and I was able to verify that the error actually occurs, however, I did a rollback Google Maps to version 9.76.1 where it was possible to show and change the label

There are official forums -> https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/129726279

Please take this info if you are running any version of Google Maps that has this feature disabled / removed.
